Last revised by Daniel McNary on 12/11/2016

User Guide: 
The application will open to a main menu screen featuring 5 Buttons, Tower Locations, Configure Radio, Upload Configuration, Align Antenna, and Setup Account. To date, the only active buttons are Tower Locations and Setup Account. 

Tower Locations: 
Currently will open Google Maps on the host device centered on the Internet Associates Network Operations Center (NOC). (Sidenote: The alternate standalone project impliments a in-application map that displays pins on several towers and retrieves the user's current location. This has not yet been able to be implimented in this version of the project.) 

Configure Radio:
Currently opens a empty activity screen. (Sidenote: This will eventually allow the user to open a connection to a IP-based radio on the same LAN as the user for changes to be made to the radio ex. SSID, IP Address, et cetera). 

Upload Configuration: 
Currently opens a empty activity screen. (Sidenote: This will eventually allow inexperienced users easy access to upload pre-configured configuration files for an IP-based radio or allow any user for a faster experience in programming an IP-based radio with certain default parameters, such as SSID, Netmask, Gateway, DNS, et cetera). 

Align Antenna: 
Currently opens a empty activity screen. (Sidenote: This will eventually display to the user certain signal strength related parameters to the user for alignment purposes. This may include Signal Strength, Transmit CCQ, Quality, Capacity that are related to the antenna being aligned by the installer/technician). 

Setup Account: 
Opens a current list of contacts to the installer that are in need of being processed. The user can press the drop down menu at the top right to add a new contact. Additionally, a user can select an existing contact to see more details. 

  Add Contact: Several text fields are made available. Whe appropriate information has been entered, the user can press on "Save Contact" to add the contact to the database. 
  
  Contact Details: A new activity is opened that displays pertinent contact information. (Sidenote: Additional contact information will be added in a later version.) By clicking the drop down menu, the user can choose to either edit the contact or delete the contact. 
  
Note: You may have to close the application and re-launch it to return to the main menu.
